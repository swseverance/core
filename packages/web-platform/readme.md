## Glue42 Web Platform

A Web Platform application (or "Main application") in the context of **Glue42 Core** is a web application that uses the [`@glue42/web-platform`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/web-platform) package. This app is responsible for configuring the entire Glue42 environment and acts as a central hub for all [Web Client](https://core-docs.glue42.com/core-concept/web-client/overview/index.html) apps in your **Glue42 Core** project. All Glue42 operations are routed through this Main application, meaning that this is the place where you can get centralized logging, information about all operations and details about the general state of your project. The configuration for all Glue42 libraries (e.g., Application Management, Layouts, Workspaces, Plugins, Notifications) is handled here.

The Main application also provides tracking and control over non-Glue42 applications opened through it. The level of control is limited, but all basic operations are available - open, close, receiving events, listing, adding and manipulating via [Workspaces](https://core-docs.glue42.com/capabilities/windows/workspaces/index.html).

If the Main application is closed, all [Web Client](https://core-docs.glue42.com/core-concept/web-client/overview/index.html) applications will lose their connection to Glue42 and therefore - all Glue42 capabilities. Opening the Main app again *won't reestablish the connection*, because this will effectively be an entirely new window with a new session and new context. However, if the Main application is *refreshed*, the existing [Web Client](https://core-docs.glue42.com/core-concept/web-client/overview/index.html) apps will detect that and *will reconnect* as soon as the Main app is back online.
