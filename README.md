[**Glue42 Core**](https://core-docs.glue42.com/getting-started/what-is-glue42-core/index.html) is a toolkit for integrating web applications. With the powerful interoperability and window management features of **Glue42 Core** you can enable multiple apps to share information between each other and unify them in streamlined coherent workflows.

**Glue42 Core** works in all modern browsers and focuses on use cases with Progressive Web Applications.

## Features Overview

### Interop Services

**Glue42 Core** exposes a rich set of interoperability methods which allow web applications to seamlessly communicate and interact with each other. The message exchange happens on the client, through a shared web worker process.

### Window Management

**Glue42 Core** provides an abstraction layer on top of the standard browser window management APIs, which makes your app portable between **Glue42 Core** and [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/desktop-enterprise/). This allows you to create, close and manipulate browser/PWA windows.

### Layout Persistence

**Glue42 Core** supports persistence of window layouts. Users can conveniently resume working on a task from the exact state in which they left it, saving time and effort to recreate the necessary layout of open apps and window arrangement.

For a more detailed look at all available features and functionalities, see the **Glue42 Core** [Capabilities](https://core-docs.glue42.com/capabilities/application-management/index.html) documentation.

### Glue42 Enterprise Compatibility

If you need advanced window management or connectivity to native applications, you can run your app in the [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/desktop-enterprise/) Desktop Client without any changes to your code.

To find out what advanced features and solutions **Glue42 Enterprise** offers, see the official **Glue42 Enterprise** [product documentation](https://docs.glue42.com/).

### React Bindings

In addition to the standard JavaScript API, the [Interop](https://docs.glue42.com/glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/interop/overview/index.html) methods are exposed through framework specific bindings for the most popular web frameworks, further facilitating the integration of **Glue42 Core** functionalities in your existing codebase. Currently, we have [React bindings](https://core-docs.glue42.com/getting-started/setting-application/react/index.html) based on Hooks. Angular bindings will be available soon.
